# Guppy Style Guide

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to our style guide.

This documentation will help new developers see how Guppy components can be used. In addition to common components such as Buttons, Inputs, etc, you will also find components that are functional rather than visual (e.g. `MountAfter`). We hope this helps developers get up and running quickly with Guppy development.

Happy contributing!

## Usage

In development, run `yarn docz:dev` to start the Docz development server.
